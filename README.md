# Hi 👋, I'm Polim

I work mainly on the frontend writing ReactJS code, however I'm also becoming interested in the fullstack approach, with some knowledge around NodeJS and GraphQL that I aim to build on through personal projects.

## 📚 I'm currently learning:

- NextJS
- Storybook
- Testing/TDD
- GraphQL
